Clone failed: Could not read from remote repository.

从远程 git 仓库克隆项目到本地  出现


clone failed. Could not read from remote repository".


解决办法


Check the following setting:

Settings -> Version Control -> Git -> SSH Executable

If it's set to Built-in switch to Native and give it a try.

Make sure you have the files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub stored in the correct location as well.
